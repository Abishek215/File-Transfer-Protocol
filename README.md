# File-Transfer-Protocol

File Transfer Protocol is a standard network protocol used to transfer files from one host to another host over a TCP based network such as internet. 
This protocol can be used to upload or download files form one host to another. 
This protocol is based on cilent-server architecture and may use different control and data connections between the client and the server.
I tried to implement FTP to transfer files within and over the network(using internet) using python language.
